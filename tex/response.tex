\section{Pseudopolynomial time}

When discussing complexity of the algorithms related to gluings, each polygon of the gluing is considered as a separate entity taking up some space in the input. That is why our original submission said that the running time is polynomial. We have added to the abstract that if $n$ is considered the only input of our algorithm, then the running time is pseudopolynomial (polynomial in $n$).

\section{Other details mentioned}

We have mentioned in the abstract that all the squares are unit squares.

We have mentioned in the introduction that the polygons of the gluing may be folded in order to glue the polyhedron.

We have checked that every time $n$ is mentioned in the paper for complexity of an algorithm or for a bound, it is also mentioned that $n$ is the number of squares / tiles.

\section{Related version}

We have put the extended version of the paper with full proofs to {\it ar$\chi$iv} and included the link to the related version in our submission.
