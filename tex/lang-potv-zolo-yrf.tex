\maketitle

\begin{abstract}We give all the sufficient reasoning and describe a polynomial algorithm that allows to list and classify all edge-to-edge gluings of squares that correspond to convex polyhedra. We show that the number of such gluings of $n$ squares is polynomial in $n$. The methods we use to acheve this can be applied in several similar settings, including gluings of regular hexagons and triangles.\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

\section{Adaptation of Chen—Han algorithm for arbitrary edge-to-edge gluings of squares}

In this section, we show the runtime of Chen—Han algorithm, whose input is an edge-to-edge gluing of squares, and the squares need not to be faces of the resulting polyhedron.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:shortestSquare}
	If $T$ is a square of the gluing and $\pi$ is a geodesic shortest path between two vertices $p_1$, $p_2$ of the gluing then the intersection between $\pi$ and $T$ consists of at most 5 segments.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	To prove this theorem, we show that there is at most one segment for each pair of adjacent sides of $T$ with endpoints on these sides, and at most one segment whose endpoints lie on opposite sides of $T$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary} \label{cor:chruntime}
	For an arbitrary gluing $\Gamma$ of $n$ squares and a vertex $v$ of this gluing, Chen—Han algorithm for $\Gamma$ and $v$ runs in $O(n^2)$ time.
\end{corollary}

\section{Bounds on the number of egde-to-edge gluings of squares}

In this section, we prove that the number of edge-to-edge gluings of $n$ squares is polynomial in $n$. This result allows to develop a polynomial algorithm to list all the valid gluings.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:n36}
	There are $O \left( n^{36} \right)$ edge-to-edge gluings of at most $n$ squares that satisfy Alexandrov's conditions.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} To prove the theorem, we triangulate the polyhedron corresponding to the net and draw its faces on the square grid. We note that an edge shared by two faces must have the same lengths of $x$- and $y$-projections on the drawings of these faces, see Figure~\ref{fig:edgesMeeting}. Then we count the number of sets of triangles satisfying this restriction and taking up at most $n$ squares.

\begin{figure}[h] \centering
\tikz[scale=0.45]{
	\foreach \i in {-1,...,6} {
		\draw[gray] (-1,\i) -- (6,\i) (\i,-1) -- (\i,6);
	}
	\draw[very thick,red] (4,5) -- (5,2);
	\draw[thick] (5,2) -- ++(-2,-2) -- ++(-3,0) --
		++(0,2) -- ++(1,3) -- ++(3,0);
}\hspace{1.2cm}
\tikz[scale=0.45]{
	\foreach \i in {-1,...,6} {
		\draw[gray] (-1,\i) -- (6,\i) (\i,-1) -- (\i,6);
	}
	\draw[very thick,red] (0,4) -- (3,5);
	\draw[thick] (3,5) -- ++(2,-2) -- ++(0,-3) --
		++(-3,0) -- ++(-2,2) -- ++(0,2);
}
\caption{Highlighted edge has the same lengths of projections on the drawings of two faces}
\label{fig:edgesMeeting}
\end{figure}

To do so, we choose $x$- and $y$-projections for each of at most 18 edges and note that there is at most two ways to place each edge such that the convexity of the face is preserved, those differ by $\frac{\pi}{2}$, see Figure~\ref{fig:twoWays}. \end{proof}

\begin{figure}[h] \centering
\tikz[scale=0.45]{
	\foreach \i in {0,...,6} {
		\draw[gray] (0,\i) -- (6,\i) (\i,0) -- (\i,6);
	}
	\draw[thick] (1,0)--(2,3);
	\draw[thick,red,dashed] (4,6)--(2,3)--(5,1);
}
\caption{There are two ways to place each edge preserving convexity of the face}
\label{fig:twoWays}
\end{figure}

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:n52}
	There are $\Omega \left( n^{\frac52} \right)$ edge-to-edge gluings of at most $n$ squares that satisfy Alexandrov's conditions.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} To prove the theorem, we construct a series of such gluings. These gluings correspond to doubly-covered polygons, the polygons being obtained by cutting edges of a rectangle with sides no longer than $\frac{\sqrt{n}}{2}$, see Figure~\ref{fig:cutExA}.

\input{img/fig-examples}

If the length of the shorter side of the rectangle is equal to $b$, then there is $\left( b(b+1) / 2 \right)^2$ ways to choose how much of angles is cut. However, to count only valid gluings, we have to count in that in some cases the sides of angles we cut do not meet at a node of the grid, see Figure~\ref{fig:cutExB}, and that one polygon can be obtained from several rectangles, see Figure~\ref{fig:cutExC}. This yields the final formula.\end{proof}

\section{Listing the gluings}

We implemented an algorithm that lists all the gluings of at most $n$ squares for a given graph structure of a convex polyhedron. We want to point out that one gluing can admit several ways to cut itself into flat polygons. Thus it can appear in the list several times.

\input{app/yrf-example}

\begin{example}
	A doubly covered parallelogram shown in Figure~\ref{fig:twonets} admits two ways to cut itself into two flat quadrilaterals, the latter consisting of the faces of the polyhedron.
\end{example}
