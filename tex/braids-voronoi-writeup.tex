\section{Definitions}

\begin{definition}
	\emph{A Voronoi diagram} is a subdivision of a \(n \times m\) table equipped with a greedy braid into regions such that
   \begin{enumerate}
	\item Left boundary of each region is composed of a single braid strand and possibly a piece of the boundary;
	\item Right boundary of each region is composed of several pieces \(e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_k\) of braid strands, such that \begin{enumerate}
	   \item the pieces \(e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_k\) cross no strand from left to right,
	   \item the strand containing \(e_i\) crosses the strand containing \(e_{i+1}\) from left to right at the point where \(e_i\) meets \(e_{i+1}\), \(i = 1,\ldots, k-1\).
	\end{enumerate}
   \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
	The following are equivalent:
   \begin{enumerate}
	\item Point \(p\) belongs to the Voronoi cell \(f_i\) of a Voronoi site \(s_i\);
	\item Site \(s_i\) is the leftmost site such that there is a path from \(s_i\) to \(p\) that crosses no braid strand from left to right.
   \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\section{Query}

\begin{problem}
	Given braid \braid, the lower right corners \(c_0^{-h}, \ldots, c_{m+n}^{-h}\) of the Voronoi cells of \(\VD^{-h}\), point \(p\) and a number \(i\), check whether \(p \in f_i^{-h}\), \(p\) is to the left or to the right from \(f_i^{-h}\).
\end{problem}

\begin{lemma}
	The following are equivalent:
   \begin{enumerate}
	\item Point \(p\) belongs to the Voronoi cell \(f_i^{-h}\) of \(\VD^{-h}\);
	\item There is a path from \(s_i\) to \(c_i^{-h}\) passing through \(p\) that crosses no strand of \braid twice.
   \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

The path can utilize diagonal edges, see Figure~\ref{fig:vd-ex},~(c): \(p_1 \in f_6^{-2}\) (green), \(p_2 \in f_7^{-2}\) (yellow).

\subsection{Entanglement of triples oracle}

\begin{definition}
	We call two triples of numbers \(\lr*{a_1, a_2, a_3}\),
	\(\lr*{b_1, b_2, b_3}\) \emph{entangled} if
	\[ a_1 < b_1,\ a_2 > b_2,\ a_3 < b_3\quad\text{or}\quad
	   a_1 > b_1,\ a_2 < b_2,\ a_3 > b_3\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:entgtripls}
	There exists a data structure that can store a set of \(n\) triples
	\[S = \set*{\lr*{a^1_1, a^1_2, a^1_3}, \ldots, \lr*{a^n_1, a^n_2, a^n_3}}\]
	and, given a query triple \(q = \lr*{q_1, q_2, q_3}\), output
	in time \(\Ot\lr*{1}\)  %  Count logs precisely
	the number of triples in \(S\) that are entangled with \(q\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Store the set \(S\) in a 3-dimensional range tree [{\color{magenta} cite!}].
	A \(d\)-dimensional range tree is a data structure that stores several points
	in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) and effectively reports all the stored points that are
	inside a \(d\)-dimensional rectangular parallelepiped defined by
	its lower and higher coordinates on each axis.

\begin{figure}[ht] \centering
	\input{imgb/paral-trans}

	\caption{(a) A triple \(\lr*{a^i_1, a^i_2, a^i_3}\) entangled
	with \(\lr*{q_1, q_2, q_3}\),
	         (b) a range query that finds this triple}
	\label{fig:paral-trans}
\end{figure}

	An entanglement query can then be interpreted as two 3-dimensional range
	queries, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:paral-trans}:
   \begin{enumerate}
	\item \(a_1 < q_1,\ a_2 > q_2,\ a_3 < q_3\) is a 3-dimensional parallelepiped
	  to the left, further and lower than the point \(\lr*{q_1, q_2, q_3}\)
	  (call this \emph{left entanglement query});
	\item \(a_1 > q_1,\ a_2 < q_2,\ a_3 > q_3\) is a 3-dimensional parallelepiped
	  to the right, closer and higher than the point \(\lr*{q_1, q_2, q_3}\)
	  (call this \emph{right entanglement query}).
   \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
	The construction of a 3-dimensional range tree takes \(O \lr*{n \log^2 n}\) time,
	and a range query takes \(O \lr*{\log n}\) time.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Entanglement of strands oracle}

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:entgstrands}
	There exists a data structure that can store a reduced embedded braid \braid and,
	given an arbitrary point triple \(g = (0,r)\), \(h = (k,s)\), \(f = (\ell,t)\),
	decide in time \(\Ot\lr*{1}\) if there exists a path from \(g\) to \(f\)
	through \(h\) that is not double-crossed by any strand.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	To build the data structure, first partition the grid of height \(n\)
	hierarchically into \(O\lr*{n}\) canonical strips located in a binary tree:
	each canonical strip contains two canonical strips of half its height.

	For each canonical strip \(\lr*{a, b}\) build an entanglement of triples
	oracle (Theorem~\ref{thm:entgtripls}): for each strand \(s\) store the triple
	\(\lr*{s_0, s_a, s_b}\) of its positions at the ground of the grid,
	the top of the canonical strip, and the bottom of
	the canonical strip respectively.

	In total there are \(O\lr*{n}\) entanglement of triples oracles,
	the construction of them takes \(O\lr*{n^2 \log^2 n}\) time.

\begin{figure}[ht] \centering
   \input{imgb/eostrands}
   \caption{The decomposition of the strip~\(\lr*{k, \ell}\) into canonical strips;
            boundaries \(\lr*{L_i, R_i}\) of entanglement-free regions} 
   \label{fig:eostrands}
\end{figure}

	To answer the query, decompose the strip~\((k,\ell)\) into
	canonical strips~\(c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_v\), the indexation is from the bottom
	of the strip upwards (see Figure~\ref{fig:eostrands}). At each
	boundary of neighboring canonical strips~\(c_i\), \(c_{i+1}\) we maintain
	an \emph{entanglement-free region}~\(\left[ L_i, R_i \right]\) which is
	the region where the not-double-crossed path can pass through.

	It is obvious that at least one such path from~\(g\) to \(f\) exists, therefore
	each entanglement-free region is nonempty. Naturally, \(L_0 = R_0 = f\).
	Points~\(L_{i+1}, R_{i+1}\) are constructed from \(L_i, R_i\) recursively:
   \begin{enumerate}
	\item \(L_{i+1}\) is the leftmost point such that any strand that is
	  to the left of \(g\) and \(L_i\) is also to the left of \(L_{i+1}\),
	\item \(R_{i+1}\) is the rightmost point such that any strand that is
	  to the right of \(g\) and \(R_i\) is also to the right of \(R_{i+1}\).
   \end{enumerate}
	Given \(L_i\), we find \(L_{i+1}\) using binary search in the boundary
	of~\(c_{i+1}, c_{i+2}\): if for a point~\(p\) the left entanglement query
	for~\(\lr*{g, p, L_i}\) returns some strands, descend to the right,
	otherwise descend to the left.
	Given \(R_i\), we find \(R_{i+1}\) in a symmetric way.

\begin{lemma} \label{lm:entg}
	The recursive construction of~\(L_i, R_i\) is correct;
	the following are equivalent:
   \begin{itemize}
	\item[a)] a point \(p\) is to the left of \(L_i\),
	\item[b)] there exists a strand that is to the left of \(g\) and \(f\),
	  but to the right of \(p\).
   \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} \begin{itemize}
	\item \( \text{b)} \Rightarrow \text{a)} \): Assume that \(p\) is
	to the right of (or equal to) \(L_i\), see Figure~\ref{fig:entga}.
	The strand~\(\sigma\), which is to the left of~\(g\) and~\(f\), but
	to the right of~\(p\), is also to the right of~\(L_i\); this contradicts
	the construction of~\(L_i\). 

\begin{figure}[ht] \centering
   \input{imgb/entg}
   \caption{Proof of Lemma~\ref{lm:entg}}
\end{figure}

	\item \( \text{a)} \Rightarrow \text{b)} \): Proof by induction in~\(i\);
	assume there are no strands that are to the left of~\(g\) and~\(f\),
	but to the right of~\(p\). There is however a strand~\(\sigma_1\)
	between~\(L_i\) and~\(p\) that made us descend to the right when performing
	the binary search for~\(L_i\); \(\sigma_1\) is to the left of~\(L_{i-1}\),
	see Figure~\ref{fig:entgb}. The strand~\(\sigma_1\) must be
	to the right of~\(f\), since it is to the left of~\(g\)
	and to the right of~\(p\).

	Take a point~\(p^\prime\) immediately to the left of~\(\sigma_1\)
	at the level of~\(L_{i-1}\). By the induction hypothesis, there exists a strand
	that is to the left of~\(g\) and~\(f\), but to the right of~\(p^\prime\),
	call it \(\sigma_2\). The strand~\(\sigma_2\) must cross \(\sigma_1\)
	below~\(p^\prime\), since \(\sigma_2\) is to the left of~\(f\), and \(p^\prime\)
	is the immediate left neighbor of~\(\sigma_1\).

	Since the braid is reduced, \(\sigma_2\) is to the right of~\(p\);
	this contradicts the assumption for~\(p\).
\end{itemize} \end{proof}

	Lemma~\ref{lm:entg} implies that there exists a path from~\(g\) to~\(f\)
	through~\(h\) that is not double-crossed by any strand if and only if \(h\)
	is between~\(L_v\) and~\(R_v\). Moreover, if \(h\) is outside the
	entanglement-free region, we can conclude whether there is a right or left
	entanglement of the \(g\)-to-\(h\)-to-\(f\) path with a strand of~\braid.
	
\begin{remark}
	The strip~\(\lr*{k, \ell}\) is decomposed into~\(O\lr*{\log n}\)
	canonical strips, therefore there is as much entanglement-free regions
	to be calculated. For each region~\(\lr*{L_i, R_i}\) two binary searches
	with~\(O\lr*{\log n}\) probes are done. Each probe calls a range query
	that takes \(O\lr*{\log n}\) time. In total, the entanglement of strands
	query takes \(O\lr*{\log^3 n}\) time.
\end{remark}
\end{proof}
