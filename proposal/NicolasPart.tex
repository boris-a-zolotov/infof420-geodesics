\section{Nicolas' part: implementation of Chen—Han Algorithm}
Chen—Han algorithm is presented in~\cite{chen-han}. It is needed to build knowledge about the gluing. It has to be generalized from the case of the net of a polyhedron to an arbitrary gluing where polygons need not to be faces.\par
The API built to interface Chen \& Han will be the core of this part and serve to demonstrate the algorithm through interactive examples coded in JavaScript. The aim is to propose an educational resource to explain this algorithm in an intuitive and visual manner.\par
